NO POINT BANNERS
----------------

(We should only implement those of these that are easy to implement.
None are necessary, all would be fun I think.)

"The Pantheon": Chose every God not as a starting God (across all
games by that player). (Beogh and Lugonu are tricky here! Also
detecting this is vaguely tricky; technically it works out to "died or
won with every God with a character class that cannot start as that
God.)

"Xom Prefers A Heretic": Has abandoned and mollified every God (across
all games by that player)

"Discovered Language": Has obtained at least one rune.

"Runic Literacy": Has seen each type of rune at least once.

"Moose and Squirrel": Has killed Boris at least twice in a single game.

"The Atheist": Won a character who never took a god and was not a DG.

"The Scythe": Award banner for "I killed Sigmund twenty-seven times."

"The Orb": Award banner for winning.

"Shop Until You Drop": Spent more than 5000 gold and ended with less than 50.

"Free Will": Ended with a high-level title of Fire as Ice or Ice as
Fire elementalist, or Air as Earth or Earth as Air elementalist.

"Ghostbuster": Killed ten or more ghosts.
