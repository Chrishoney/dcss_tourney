      was finished, and the bonus has not expired before the game was finished.
    - Track bonuses in a flat file?
    - Add a script to define the bonus combo.
    - Allow user to specify the combo, but ensure it has not already been
      won (by checking Henzell's db) before placing the bonus.

of special wins points, sum total of high scores points,
plus "Clan points only" trophies above.

NO POINT BANNERS
----------------

(We should only implement those of these that are easy to implement.
None are necessary, all would be fun I think.)

"The Pantheon": Chose every God not as a starting God (across all
games by that player). (Beogh and Lugonu are tricky here! Also
detecting this is vaguely tricky; technically it works out to "died or
won with every God with a character class that cannot start as that
God.)

"Xom Prefers A Heretic": Has abandoned and mollified every God (across
all games by that player)

"Discovered Language": Has obtained at least one rune.

"Runic Literacy": Has seen each type of rune at least once.

"Moose and Squirrel": Has killed Boris at least twice in a single game.

"The Atheist": Won a character who never took a god and was not a DG.

"The Scythe": Award banner for "I killed Sigmund twenty-seven times."

"The Orb": Award banner for winning.

"Shop Until You Drop": Spent more than 5000 gold and ended with less than 50.

"Free Will": Ended with a high-level title of Fire as Ice or Ice as
Fire elementalist, or Air as Earth or Earth as Air elementalist.

"Ghostbuster": Killed ten or more ghosts.
