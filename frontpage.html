We need to display:
 * players with most points 3/2/1
 * clans with most points 3/2/1
 * first victory 3/2/1
 * first allruner 3/2/1
 * fastest win in realtime 3/2/1
 * fastest win by turncount 3/2/1
 * most uniques killed 3/2/1
 * most high scores per race/class combo 3/2/1
 * clan with most uniques killed 3/2/1
 * clan with most high scores per ... 3/2/1
 * lowest DLvl at XL1 3/2/1
 * ten lowest race/class combinations right now

Optional:
 * link to _all_ race/class HS (this should be done eventually)
 * players currently on a streak
 * longest streak
 * links to individual player and clan pages (important eventually)
 * have scoring wins link to a morgue

OK this table thing works out great, I've looked at it in a couple of browsers.
So what I am going to do is make a template for it and then I guess there will
be code that fills in the template? Maybe every ten minutes, maybe on page load? 

<table border=1>
<tr>
<td>Leading Player
<ul><li>Player1 : score</li><li>Player2 : score</li><li>Player3 : score</li></ul>
</td>
<td>Leading Clan
<ul><li>Clan1 : score</li><li>Clan2 : score</li><li>Clan3 : score</li></ul>
</td>
<td>First Victory
<ul><li>Player1 : time</li><li>Player2 : time</li><li>Player3 : time</li></ul>
</td>
</tr>
<!-- and then there would be more -->
</table>
