TODO for tourney11, as of Jul 11:

* fix scoring to agree with the rules

  - add back in 10 points per win

  - change "most combo high scores" to clan points

  - add back in Nemelex' Choice, but with changes to the timing and scoring

  - change streak points to be by race/class

  - speedrun and scorerun scoring changes (but keep them on the leaderboard)

  - remove the 50 points for first allruner, since scorerun covers that

  - race/class points changes

  - banner changes: remove pennants, rename pennants to banners, bring back
    some banners (with updates), code new ones
    - remove lairless points while doing this

  - god points changes

* update lists of combos/uniques/anything else (Nemelex combos!)

* update banner credits after we have all banner images

* fix titles of some tourney pages (and maybe reorganize them a little)

* put point values with the race/class win stuff

* improve Nemelex' Choice display

* fix directory names to work with 0.9 and with being hosted on CAO
  - don't forget clan signup

* test with 0.8 tourney data at some point... will require changing lots of numbers

* test on CAO well in advance, even if I'm still coding a few features

* get stuff announced

--

features requested last tourney that would be good to have:
* race/class high scores listing

* clan best games listing (this is sort of vague)
