TODO for tourney11, as of Jul 14:

* fix scoring to agree with the rules

  - add back in Nemelex' Choice, but with changes to the timing and scoring and
    combo selection

  - test out these banners in 0.9: ENSTV

* zotdef?? currently leaning towards no

* update banner credits after we have all banner images

* fix titles of some tourney pages (and maybe reorganize them a little)

* improve Nemelex' Choice display

* fix directory names to work with 0.9 and with being hosted on CAO
  - don't forget clan signup

* test on CAO well in advance, even if I'm still coding a few features

* get stuff announced

--

features requested last tourney that would be good to have:
* race/class high scores listing

* clan best games listing (this is sort of vague)
