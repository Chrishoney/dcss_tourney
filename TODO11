* test on CAO with 0.9
  - don't forget to check that clan signup is working

misc. features requested:

* clan best games listing? this is sort of vague, I'm not sure exactly what
     was desired
* sif banner progress? doesn't really seem necessary
* fix cross-server streaking? not really a problem probably, seems quite tricky
