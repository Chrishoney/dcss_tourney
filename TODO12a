TODO for tourney12a, as of Jan 26:

* finalize rule list

* fix scoring to agree with the rules
  - different number of classes means class point formula is different
  - add god "stock exchange" points
  - add br.enter, br.end points
  - change old god points to be not just for winners
  - remove the 10 points for every win after the first one.
  - banners!
  - change Nemelex selection to not worry about repeating races/classes

* update credits

* fix stuff that might be broken by having a new month during the tourney

* fix stuff that might be affected by hive removal

* figure out where scripts will be hosted

* test stuff

* get banner images

* get stuff announced
