TODO for tourney12a, as of Jan 27:

* finalize rule list
  - mainly just polishing left and figuring out the best way of presenting
    the banners

* fix scoring to agree with the rules
  - different number of classes means class point formula is different
  - add god "stock exchange" points
  - add br.enter, br.end points
  - change old god points to be not just for winners
  - remove the 10 points for every win after the first one.
  - banners!
  - change Nemelex selection to look at high scores... probably pick randomly from the lowest 20ish combos that don't repeat, so it isn't too predictable

* fix stuff that might be broken by having a new month during the tourney

* fix stuff that might be affected by hive removal

* get banner images

* update credits

* get stuff announced

* test stuff
