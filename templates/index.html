          <p>
            Hello all! Welcome to the rules for the crawl.akrasiac.org
            2009 Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup Tournament. The simple part:
            Play on <a href="http://crawl.akrasiac.org">crawl.akrasiac.org</a>
            or <a href="http://crawl.develz.org">crawl.develz.org</a> and all of
            your Crawl 0.5.1 games that <b>start after midnight UTC on
            August 1</b> will count toward the tournament.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you wish to be a member of a clan, which may contain
            six or fewer members, you need to add a line to the top of
            your CAO rcfile like this:
          </p>

          <pre>
# TEAMCAPTAIN nameofcaptain</pre>

          <p>
            This should be the very first line of your rcfile, with no
            blank lines or comments appearing before this line. The #
            is important to make sure Crawl doesn't try to parse the
            team data as an option.
          </p>

          <p>
            The team captain must put more information in her
            .crawlrc, specifically these two lines:
          </p>

          <pre>
# TEAMNAME nameofteam
# TEAMMEMBERS player1 player2 player3 player4 player5</pre>

          <p>
            Again, these lines should be the very first two lines in
            the team captain's rcfile, with no blank lines or anything
            else appearing before these lines.
          </p>

          <p>
            Clan names must contain only alphanumeric characters,
            underscores, and hyphens. Once a player's username is in
            the captain's rc and the captain's username is in the
            player's rc and our script checks for updates, the
            players will be in the same clan!
          </p>

          <p>
            The big change this year will be the addition of award
            banners: Things you can get that put you on a list as
            achieving a certain goal in the tournament. Some of them
            are pretty standard: Rune, Win. Some of them are a
            little goofier and it's theoretically possible to win
            the tournament without getting them. How did we come up
            with these banners, you might ask? Well, I asked each of
            the Crawl gods to contribute something, and what they
            came up with is at the end...
          </p>

            <h2>WINS:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span>100 points</span> for first win. (Since winning
                is kind of the goal.)
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>50 points</span> for second win that is not a

              </li>
              <li>
                <span>10 points</span> for each win thereafter, repeat
                or not.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>50 extra points</span> for your first all-rune

              </li>
              <li>
                <span>100 extra points</span> for each consecutive win

              </li>

              <li>
                <span>30 extra points</span> for each consecutive win
                that is a repeat race xor class.
              </li>

              <li>
                <span>10 extra points</span> for each consecutive win
                that is a repeat race and class.
              </li>

              <li>
                <span>30 extra points</span> for each non-consecutive
                win that is not a repeat race or class.
              </li>

              <li>
                <span>10 extra points</span> for each non-consecutive
                win that is a repeat race xor class.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              For streak wins, "Repeat" means "in that streak;" for
              non-streak wins, "repeat" means "ever."

            <p>1 point each time you find any rune a second or later time.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2>UNIQUES</h2>

            <p><span>5 points</span> the first time you kill each
              unique.</p>

            <p><span>50/20/10 points</span> for most unique uniques
              killed; ties broken by who gets that number first.</p>

            <p>
              These get you clan points but do not get you points
              toward the individual prize, encouraging
              specialization on clans but making the hypothetical
              "Best Crawl Player" award based on more "real"
              metrics.

            <p><span>50/20/10 points</span> for lowest dungeon level reached at XL1.</p>

            <p>
              <span>200/100/50 points</span> for <b>clan</b> with most

            <hr/>

            <p>
              Trog, who hates spellcasters, would like to award THE
              SCYTHE to any player who kills Sigmund twenty-seven
              times over the course of the month.
            </p>

            <hr/>

            <p>
              Makhleb thinks players shouldn't need gods to get
              items, and encourages the player to SHOP UNTIL YOU
              DROP, ending a game in which she obtained at least
              5000 gold with 50 or less.
            </p>

              XOM PREFERS A HERETIC and thinks it would be hilarious
              if a player managed to mollify every god over the
              course of the whole month.

              Nemelex wants to see players struggle and loves
              randomness, and so will give the NEMELEX' CHOICE award
              to anyone who wins an unwon combo randomly chosen and
              announced periodically throughout the tournament.

            <p>
              Vehumet hates spellcasters who make a mockery of mighty
              magics, and so will give you the MOOSE AND SQUIRREL
              award for killing Boris twice in a single game.

            <p>
              Sif Muna thinks it's great when a spellcaster shows
              FREE WILL and maximizes the elemental spell skill
              opposite from their starting class: So, for example, a
              player who maxed out Ice Magic as a Fire Elementalist
              would get this award.
            </p>

            <p>
              Zin thinks an education is crucial to maintaining a

              rune at least once.

            <hr/>

            <p>
              Elyvilon thinks it's important to check out what all
              the gods have to offer and thus wil give THE PANTHEON
              to any player who acquires every god as not a starting
              god over the course of the tournament.
            </p>

            <hr/>

            <p>
              Kiku is a terrible god and, recognizing this, will
              give followers and other players the D:1 CARTOGRAPHER
              award just for showing up. Thanks, Kiku!

              Lugonu, who hates the other gods, would like to award
