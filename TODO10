Tournament todo for 2010:

* Crawl changes needed:
  - Fedhas banner (log fruit found).

* Proposals dropped:

  - Clans as independent entities.

  - Proposal to award +20 points for getting a god to max piety -- for 2010
    let's keep the old system of requiring the player to not change a god.

* Nail down final set of rules:

  - Review email thread
  
  - Decide on clan status.

* Show characters won in the tournament for both Crawl and Sprint (this
  is for the extra points for unwon combos)

* Final banners:

  - Fedhas: Fruit basket: find every type of fruit in one game.

  - Cheibriados: RELAXED (last win of the tournament,
    i.e. win with latest starting time)

  - Jiyva: destroying the orb.

* New Nemelex' Choice plan:
  - Pick 0.7-valid character that has < 2 wins since 0.4

* due is on banners

* Add support for Sprint games to the tournament scripts.

* Update scripts for 2010 rules.

* Run tournament test run for July.

* Put 0.7 up on cao, set up Sprint menu on CAO for testing, hardwired
  to new Sprint map.

  script.
