Tournament todo for 2010:

* Banner images and text pending (due is on this)

* Use available banner images.

* Check that noun is being set correctly for br.enter milestones.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

* Implement Nemelex' Choice plan:
  - Two cron-jobs for churn + cao + test that it works.
  - Make sure Nemelex' Choice works correctly without needing manual kicks
    to the tourney scripts

* Empty existing Nemelex Choice list.

* Carefully review each rule from http://crawl.akrasiac.org/tourney10/ and
  make sure it's coded.

* Check Nemelex mollification.

* Run tournament test run for July.

* Streamline banner code.

* Put 0.7 up on cao, set up Sprint menu on CAO for testing, hardwired
  to new Sprint map.

* Point tourney scripts at 0.7.

* Restrict Sprint scoring to new map.

* Remove all test-run code.

* Sprint+new map should be activatable by a one-line change to the
  launch script on both cao and cdo. Map name is dungeon_sprint_mu
