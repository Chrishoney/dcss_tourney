This is an attempt to track things that we still need to do for the
tournament in a central place. It'd be awesome if we could keep this
up-to-date, flagging things that are complete with [DONE], and adding
whatever we think of when we think of it.

I'm also not entirely sure who's doing what - here's what I think is
going on, please fix whatever's wrong so we don't duplicate each
others' work.


Front page (rax/violetj?):
 - Leading player
 - Leading clan
 - Fastest realtime win
 - Fastest turncount win
 - First 15-rune win
 - Most uniques killed
 - Most high scores (across character combinations)
 - Deepest DL at XL1
 - Clan Unique Kills
 - Clan High Scores
 - Longest streak
 - Easiest scores to snipe (lowest high-scores for character combinations)


General scoring (greensnark?):
 - Process events as they arrive in logfile / milestones and assign points
   to players / clans.


Team/clan setup (Anym?):
 - Examine .crawlrc files for clan affiliations.

Open Questions

Clans:
- Can players leave a clan at any time?

- If a player can leave a clan at any time, we may need to flag
  logfile and milestone entries with clan id to keep track of clan
  points.

Website update:
 - Possibly regenerate pages on events reaching the logfile / milestones.

 - Possibly generate pages on-demand (but this will load cao unless we
   can cache the generated pages until we know they need to be
   regenerated, at which point we're back to regenerating pages on
   events as above.)
