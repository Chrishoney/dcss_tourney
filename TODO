This is an attempt to track things that we still need to do for the
tournament in a central place. It'd be awesome if we could keep this
up-to-date, flagging things that are complete with [DONE], and adding
whatever we think of when we think of it.

I'm also not entirely sure who's doing what - here's what I think is
going on, please fix whatever's wrong so we don't duplicate each
others' work.

Other pages:
------------
 - Per player page.
   * Clan affiliation <link to clan>
   * Overall points
   * Games won
   * Recent games completed

 - Per clan page
   * Players in clan <link to players>
   * Overall points, including individual contributions?
   * Games won by all clan members.
   * Recent games completed by all clan members.

 - Tourney scoreboard
   * Top 50 scores?

 - Combo scoreboard
   * Highest score for each combo played.

Front page (rax/violetj?):
 - [DONE] Leading player
 - [DONE] Leading clan
 - [DONE] Fastest realtime win
 - [DONE] Fastest turncount win
 - [DONE] First 15-rune win
 - [DONE] Most uniques killed
 - [DONE] Most high scores (across character combinations)
 - [DONE] Deepest DL at XL1
 - [DONE] Clan Unique Kills
 - [DONE] Clan High Scores
 - [DONE] Longest streak
 - Easiest scores to snipe (lowest high-scores for character combinations)
There is a script, update-page.py, that should do all of this... except
that all of the actual db-accessing functions are just stubs, because 
rax doesn't know how to get information out of the db :/


General scoring (greensnark?):

 - [DONE] Grab cdo milestones: milestones-rel.txt from the same path as
   cdo logs.

 - [FIXED] Crippling bug: we currently process logfile entries as they arrive
   to calculate first win, etc. but this is WRONG given multiple
   logfiles from multiple servers! Damn, this needs serious refactoring.

 - [DONE] Threaded logfile read:
    - [DONE] Make sure all logfiles are up-to-date before loaddb / taildb
      runs AND
    - [DONE] Read from all logfiles threaded so that we pull entries
      from the logfile with the lowest end-time. Same goes for milestones,
      but threaded on milestone time field. The threading allows us to
      retain our simplistic model of logfile / milestone updates to
      calculate points.

 -[DONE] Process events as they arrive in logfile / milestones and assign points
   to players / clans.
In theory outline.py has most of this, but a lot of functions have one or
two lines where they need db help. The file missing_from_outline.txt shows
all of the things rax thinks we need...

 - [DONE] Calculate base score for players (including team_base_score).

 ----------------------------------------------------------
 - provide functions to calculate points that will change:
   - [DONE] Fastest win (realtime) 200/100/50
   - [DONE] Fastest win (turn)
   - [DONE] 5 points per high score in race/class combo
   - [DONE] 5 per high score in combo if win.
   - [DONE] 10 per high score in race.
   - [DONE] 10 per high score in class.
   - [DONE] 200/100/50 for most highscores in combos.
   - [DONE] Longest streak 200/100/50.
   - [DONE] Update players table with score_full as a temp column.

   - Clan points for deepest DL reached at XL1 50/20/10
   - Clan points for most high scores in combos 200/100/50
   - Clan points for most uniques killed (100/50/20)

   - Clan points: sum all individual points as well.
  ---------------------------------------------------------

Team/clan setup (Anym?):
 - [DONE] Examine .crawlrc files for clan affiliations and add them to the
   database.
 - [DONE] Update the clan affiliations periodically.

 - Freeze clan affiliations by the deadine, Aug 15 12:00:00 UTC, i.e.
   tournament halftime.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Open Questions

Clans:

- Defining clans by scanning .crawlrc has the problem that we have no
  idea which .crawlrc is authoritative. i.e. what if two players claim
  to be clan leaders for the same clan?
There's also the problem of CAO vs CDO crawlrc. I was thinking we would 
just force CAO.
-- Why not just use the team captain's name as key...?
We are! Yay.

- Can players leave a clan at any time?
rax and Anym sort of arbitrarily deicded that clans were frozen as of
Aug 15th.

- If a player can leave a clan at any time, we may need to flag
  logfile and milestone entries with clan id to keep track of clan
  points.
That is potentially problematic. I'm not sure what to do about that.
Greensnark says we update every six hours or something. OK!

Website update:
 - Possibly regenerate pages on events reaching the logfile / milestones.
   That's a lot of updates, but if it works, I think that's a good idea.

 - Possibly generate pages on-demand (but this will load cao unless we
   can cache the generated pages until we know they need to be
   regenerated, at which point we're back to regenerating pages on
   events as above.)
   I think we might as well go with events, unless we think this will 
   be faster.
