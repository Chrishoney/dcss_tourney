Tournament scoring scripts for the Dungeon Crawl tournament (DCSS)
==================================================================

Rules Template
--------------

Tourney rules are described in templates/index.mako. When updating
index.mako, run update_index.py to generate the html output.


Running scripts
---------------

To run loaddb.py:

1. Make sure MySQL is up and running, with a db 'tournament' with access to
   the user 'crawl' with no pw.

2. mysql -ucrawl -p tournament < database.sql will (re)create the tables,
   discarding any existing data.

3. ./link-setup will link the various logfiles into the current directory
   for loaddb to work on.

4. python loaddb.py will update the database with logfile and milestone
   records that are not already in the db. If interrupted, it can continue
   where it left off.

   python taildb.py will start a daemon to update the db continuously from
   the logfile and milestones. taildb is otherwise identical in behaviour
   to loaddb.py.

   
Nemelex' Choice
---------------

nemelex_select_combo.py will pick a combo; it must be run on a server
that has Sequell's game database.

nominate_combo.py will connect to the server running Sequell and fetch
the most recent Nemelex' Choice.
