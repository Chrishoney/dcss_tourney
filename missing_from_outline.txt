Need:

something to log a unique kill
 - [DONE] [greensnark] loaddb.py does this when reading milestones.
 
something to see if other people have killed all the uniques, and if so how many (there are 34)
 - 

something to see if a specific unique is killed -- 
something to see if a player has gotten a rune yet
something to log a player getting a rune
something to tell if it's my first all-rune win -- loaddb.count_wins() now takes an optional argument for "games with at least this many runes"
something to tell if this game is an all-rune win
how many all-runers happened before this game? (by anyone, not just by me, can stop at 3)
how many wins have happened before this game? (by anyone, not just by me, can stop at 3)
how many wins do I have so far? -- loaddb.count_wins()

plus everything in update-page.py
