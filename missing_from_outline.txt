something to see if a specific unique is killed
something to see if a player has gotten a rune yet
something to log a player getting a rune
something to tell if it's my first all-rune win

how many all-runers happened before this game? (by anyone, not just by me, can stop at 3)
how many wins have happened before this game? (by anyone, not just by me, can stop at 3)
