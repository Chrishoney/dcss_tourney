TODO FOR tourney11a, as of May 2:

* fix scoring to agree with the rules

  - fix clan race/class points to be by clan
  - remove points for streaking the same combo multiple times
  - make sure "longest streak" requires distinct races/classes

* add number of people who have won each race/class to some page, think about other additions/deletions

* fix banner formatting

* make whereis display last milestone, maybe? or disable it, since currently it is useless

* change top player/clan images to Wensley's new versions (when he finishes them)
