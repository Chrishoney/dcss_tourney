TODO FOR tourney11a, as of May 3:

* fix scoring to agree with the rules

  - fix clan race/class points to be by clan
  - make sure "longest streak" requires distinct races/classes

* fiddle with player/clan page formatting a bit more

* consider whether there is any more information that should be put on the scoring pages
