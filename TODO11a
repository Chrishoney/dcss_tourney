  - check over how/when ties are broken (especially for most uniques killed, should add dates there) 

* add information of portal vaults entered to player pages

* worry about slowdown of scripts

* check with rwbarton about rcfile mirroring

* get stuff announced on CDO blog

* change tourney scoring start date to the correct one
