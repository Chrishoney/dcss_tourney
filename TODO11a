TODO FOR tourney11a, as of May 1:

* fix scoring to agree with the rules

  - fix race/class points to be 2N and N points instead of 240 and 120
  - fix combo points to be only 20 if only won by one person
  - fix clan race/class points to be by clan
  - add points for fastest realtime allruner
  - add points for branchless wins
  - remove points for streaking the same combo multiple times
  - make sure "longest streak" requires distinct races/classes
  - remove Nemelex's choice (maybe I already did this?)

* fix scoring output (remove Nemelex's choice and other things that don't exist, maybe add more info somewhere)

* disable old banners, code new banners

* bring list of uniques up to date

* check whether it is actually still possible to give info about games in progress on CAO (I doubt it)

* change top player/clan images to Wensley's new versions (when he finishes them)
